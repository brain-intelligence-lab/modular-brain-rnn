# Modularity with SNN on Continual Learning and Neural Plasticity


1. Build SNN with plasticity and spatial constraints
    1. Build the SNN follow the RNN infra
    2. Build the SNN following the Feedforward NN infra, check the NeuroGym by Robert Guangyu Yang, add the SNN infra into the package
2. Potential plan:
    1. Train SNN with gradients but map the weight into physical link via STDP or some principles
        1. 
    2. Investigate the modularity and behavior, identify something interesting here
    3. Discuss different instances for their energy based on the spiking rate and connectivity
3. Expected Findings:
    1. The emergence of modularity is related to the plasticity rules
    2. A balance between global goal and local penalization
    3. The individual difference between structure and function
