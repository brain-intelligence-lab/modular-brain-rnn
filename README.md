# Functional Demands Shape Modular Brain-Like Networksbeyond Spatial Constraints

## Introduction
This is the official repository for Functional Demands Shape Modular Brain-Like Networksbeyond Spatial Constraints.
In this study we demonstrate that multitask and incremental learning enhance modularity in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) compared
to single-task learning, revealing how functional demands influence the structural organization of neural networks.
