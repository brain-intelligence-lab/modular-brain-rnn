# Overview

This is the official repository for Task-structured Modularity Emerges in Artificial Networks and Aligns with Brain Architectureã€‚
In this study we demonstrate that multitask and incremental learning enhance modularity in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) compared
to single-task learning, revealing how functional demands influence the structural organization of neural networks.
